OLIVER NOODLE VINTER LOG PROGRAM
===================================

Program is to be used as an electronic brewing log 
that can be edited by a user in a GUI.  Will be intended 
to be used in place of paper and pen

-----------------------------------

Users will want to launch program from 'main.py' until
the developer is sufficiently able to sort his life out
and get pyinstaller to work for him to make it a desk-
top executable.
